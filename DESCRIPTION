Title: Smoke dispersion modeling for GOES-16 fire detections

Description: This package uses the HYSPLIT dispersion model to calculate air quality impacts of smoke emissions calculated using GOES-16 fire detections. Users can set the desired input meteorology to support the HYSPLIT dispersion runs. The modeled dispersion results can be compared with PM2.5 surface measurements from EPA AirNow
